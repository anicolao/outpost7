# VISION: Outpost Seven

## Core Concept
Outpost Seven is a strategic tabletop game involving resource management, module construction, and outpost development. Players manage cubes, resources, and modules to expand their presence and capabilities.

## Thematic Goals
- **Sci-Fi Atmosphere**: Evoke the feeling of building and managing a futuristic outpost.
- **Strategic Depth**: Offer meaningful choices in module selection and resource allocation.
- **Engine Building**: Players build engines using color-coded modules (Blue, Green, Yellow) to generate resources and bonuses.

## Key Mechanics (Inferred)
- **Module Construction**: Building modules of different colors and levels.
- **Resource Management**: Managing resources (Blue, Green, Purple?) and cubes.
- **Bonuses**: Triggering "pops" and adding/removing cubes for strategic advantage.
